Curie Sonnet:
"I loved thee first, and thy dear love hath won me;
And I have owned it, although thou hadst not asked it:
I am a foolish prating fool to heaven,
That hides my blissful secrets from every eye:
My thoughts fly up and dwell with thee alone,
O my dear love, my dear love! Is not this joy?
My bonds are sweet; they tell me thou dost love:
I have no longer cause to say I lovâ€™d thee.
Thou must be mine and I thine, for we were made for one another."
