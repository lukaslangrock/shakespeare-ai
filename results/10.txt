Curie Sonnet:
"Let us not then be rash and of your love complain,
As though it were some light thing to contain:
Our love is great and would be greater still,
If that our great love could make it less.
Think not my heart so light, or his so light,
But that my love may be as great as his.
Is it so much, that I should mourn and pine,
Because my love is not among the living?
O no, it is the life that I should mourn,
And not loveâ€™s death, to have his love from me."
