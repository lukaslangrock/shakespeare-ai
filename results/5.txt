Davinci Sonnet:
"To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
For as you were when first your eye I ey’d,
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers’ pride;
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn’d
In process of the seasons have I seen;
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn’d, 
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
To me you are as you were; unchangeable;
But, then, my judgment is perhaps too nice:
Since I have seen you change in mood and mind, 
And that two lovers to one another prove."
