# This is Davinci generating a sonnet in the style of Shakespeare starting with the word "Shakespeare".

"Shakespeare, thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
"Else "all the poets'' with one voice would swear
"Thou hadst as much of either as should serve,
"To schmear a glove. But master of your art,
"That’s more than all the world beside can teach.
"And is all "that you know?" Then, give me that;
"A pox of your hard-won ‘art’! and if some be,
"More gentle, call them Nature’s artists then!"
