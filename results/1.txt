Davinci Sonnet:
"O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.
A crow that’s trodden on will leave a stain;
A lily, hit with a storm, will have a bruise;
But thou, unhurt in thyself, though thou hast taken
Affliction’s stroke, and worn sorrow’s livery,
Thou hast nor crow’s foot, nor blot, nor stain,
To grace the subject of truth’s history.
Pity me then, thou who art so pure and white,
That thou thyself hast pity on my truth,
And not to tell the world how well thou art,
But how I am punish’d for loving thee."
