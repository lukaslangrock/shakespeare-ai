Curie Sonnet:
"O, never was a story of more woe
Than this of mine! O love, it was full strange:
The woes that I have since thee seen are none;
But all in loveâ€™s despite. In faith they were sore-seeming.
I fear thy beauty much when thou art by,
And much I fear thee when thou art from me.
For all the world is weary of my story;
Men think that it imports them nothing to hear it:
O that mine eye might hold a cup of wonder!
I should not then be desolate for ever."
