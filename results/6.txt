Curie Sonnet:
"This is a jewel! this mine eyes gaze on;
It cannot good come of, but evil look:
To have it so before me doth invite
Ill thoughts to work in me, ill turns aside.
For on the rims thereof thou hast device;
Such vanity I know not what to call.
The very thought of it my heart doth pain,
For all the sweet in it is sick and deadly.
What hath a woman to do with grisly death?
Why should she live when so fair a jewel can die?"
