Davinci Sonnet (Tiktok):
"It is thy picture, and not thy company;
That now makes my heart burst out with rhyme:
For, if a friend thou hast that holds his peace,
In time of need to aid thee and thy rhyme;
If any such there be (as sure there is not),
Then neither white nor red can dye thy name.
Dost thou in conscience think that I could write
This glowing screed, and not omit thy name?
I will have fame with profit still conjoinâ€™d;
Then farewell peace, till some more worthy come.
In vain I see the lily's virgin hue:
The breath of heaven cannot preserve it long.
How soon may I in thee, my heart's delight,
And all thy little beauties, lose delight!
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars;
Welcome soft peace with its roses double."
