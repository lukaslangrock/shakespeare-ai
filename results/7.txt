Curie Sonnet:
"When to the session of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear timeâ€™s waste.
And then I counsel them that love is wise,
That love is prosperous and is every way;
That love is honour and is everywhere
And most in this, that love is always the same."
