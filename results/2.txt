Davinci Sonnet (My will, many edits necessary):
"My will, not my power, doth possess my thoughts in you.
One touch of you, and I am a-fire;
Your beauty, my dear, is your only eye-sight;
Your brightness blinds me with a greater dazzling.
As the moonâ€™s sphere doth act upon the sea:
Wherefore no marvel though I fain would dwell
In the admiring of your majesty,
That makes me to forget all business else.
"But since you are only woman and not goddess,
My fate will be an earthly misery;
And therefore do I pray to some power divine,
To give me leave to mourn a while in vain."
