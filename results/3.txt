Davinci Sonnet (A woman which):
"A woman which is young, and fair,
In menâ€™s eyes as goodly to appear;
As a fresh bud which on the top doth sit 
Of sweetest briar rose: or a bright jewel 
Set in the silver sea. The summer's day, 
That for his pride is only sovereign, 
To her is not so full of goodly heat: 
For oft the sun is to himself untrue;
And being clouded then she shows more bright.
Yet mark what foul trespass doth her blot, 
The weight which it bears makes still that spot."
